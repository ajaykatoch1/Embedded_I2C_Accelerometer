# Embedded_I2C_Accelerometer
In this project, we implemented an adxl1345 accelerometer on an ATmega2560 arduino board utilizing the I2C communication protocol. 
The speed could be measured in the x,y, or z axis with accurate results. We utilized C/C++ in VSCODE and platform.io. 
The included requirements pdf goes into more detail about the requirements and how I2C and the board was created and implemented. We also utilized a bread board circuit to hook up
the adxl1345 properly to the ATmega2560.
